# CarND-Behavioral-Cloning Project: Use Deep Learning to Clone Driving Behavior
###At first, I really do not have any clues about what's the deep neural network architecture look alike to handle such a problem. It is a regression problem and not a classification problem. So I asked my mentor about the architecture of the neural network and my mentor recommended me a paper called ["End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars"](https://images.nvidia.com/content/tegra/automotive/images/2016/solutions/pdf/end-to-end-dl-using-px.pdf)
